# Find Maximum Value in a Tree

## Challenge

Write a script that only takes in a Binary Tree root as its input and return the highest value in the tree. Assume this Binary Tree only contains integers.

E.G.

                        5
                3              6
        2            4      5     8

will output 8.

## Approach and Reasoning

Each node contains the value, a Left Child and a Right Child.

This challenge will make use of a customed Tree Class previously defined:

[Stack and Queue](../../Data%20Structures/Tree/)
