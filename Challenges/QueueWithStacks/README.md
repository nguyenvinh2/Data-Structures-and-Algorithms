# QUEUE WITH STACKS

## Challenge

Create a Queue Class using the functionality of Two Stack Classes. The stack classes will have the associated method of push and pop.

If the Queue is -> [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] -> , enqueueing [0] will produce:

 -> [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] -> 

Dequeuing should produce:

 -> [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] -> 

## Approach and Reasoning

Assumptions:

The stack data structure included is found in 

[Stack And Queue](../../Data%20Structures/StackAndQueue/)

The pre-built Queue Data structure will be ignored.

Null inputs will not affect the structure of the Queue.

## Solution

Output:
