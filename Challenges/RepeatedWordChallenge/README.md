# REPEATED WORD

## Challenge

Find the first repeated word in a sentence.

    Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
    Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

e.g.

Input = "Once upon a time, there was a brave princess who..."	

Ouput = "a"

## Approach and Reasoning

Assumptions:

The data structure used is the Hashtable and is found in 

[Hashtables](../../Data%20Structures/Hashtables/)

Case sensitity is ignored.
Punctuations are ignored. e.g. item would match to item!

## Solution

Output:

![Console](../../assets/string_repeat.jpg?raw=true "Output")
