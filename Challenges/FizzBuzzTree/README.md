# Fizz Buzz Tree

## Challenge

Determine wether each value of the nodes in a Tree structure is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with it’s news values.
For example,

A Node with a value of 3 will return "Fizz"
A Node with a value of 5 will return "Buzz"
A Node with a value of 15 will return "FizzBuzz"
A Node with a value of 2 will return "2"

## Approach and Reasoning

Each node contains the value, a Left Child and a Right Child.

This challenge will make use the PreOrder traversal method to evaluate each Node on a tree.
