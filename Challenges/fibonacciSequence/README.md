# FIBONACCI SEQUENCE

## Challenge

Given an input N, out the sequence in the Fibonnaci Series.

e.g.

With an input 5, the output should be 5

With an input 16, the output should be 987

With an input 45, the output should be 1134903170

## Approach and Reasoning

Assumptions: No negative integers, an exception will be thrown.

Due to type safety of C# (language of implementation), the input will be an unsigned integer.

Time efficiency - Big O will be O(N) as the size of the operations will linearly increase corresponding the size of the input.

Space efficiency - Big O with be O(1) the variables used will remain constant. 

## Solution

Stored in Program.cs
Output wil be:
