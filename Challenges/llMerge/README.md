# Link List Merge

## Challenge

Given an input K, return the Kth Node starting from the End of a specified Link List.

e.g.

If LinkList from start to end is [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] and a K input of 1 is given, return [4]. 

## Approach and Reasoning

Assumptions:

The Link List Challenge is based on an existing class on C# consisting of a Node Class
contain the properties of the Data and Pointer to the next node.
The Link List Class should be aware of the Head Node and the Current Node.
