# Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input and prints out the value of every node within the tree in order of the traversal.

E.G.

                        5
                3              6
        2            4      5     8

will output 5,3,6,2,4,5,8.

## Approach and Reasoning

Each node contains the value, a Left Child and a Right Child.

This challenge will make use of a customed defined Queue Class previously defined:

[Stack and Queue](../../Data%20Structures/StackAndQueue/)
