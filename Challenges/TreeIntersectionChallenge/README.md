# TREE INTERSECTION

## Challenge

Given an input of two Tree structures, return a list of values found in both trees.

      5                5
     /\               /\
    7   4            2  4


should return 5, 4.

## Approach and Reasoning

Assumptions:

The data structure used is the Hashtable and is found in 

[Hashtables](../../Data%20Structures/Hashtables/)

The Tree Node structured is defined within the program.

Null inputs for Node values will default to 0 due to its integer type.

## Solution

Output:
