# Insertion Sort

## Challenge

Using the Insertion Sort Algorithm, create a method that takes in an unsorted int array and returns a sorted array.

## Algorithm

The algorithm starts with the second element of the array and compares the value of it to the previous element index.

If previous value is larger, the algorithm will make a switch, otherwise the values will remain in place.

The next element will then be evaluated the same way except it will continue to compared itself with the previous existing elements until
there is no element left.

## Instructions

Download the InsertionSortAlgorithm solution. Run the Program or reference it as a dll to incorporate it into your project. 


## API

The unsorted array can be of varied size.

This data structure lies in the Program.cs class and only has one method.

    InsertionSort(int[] input):

    Takes in any int array and returns an array with the values in the input array sorted.
